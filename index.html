  <h2><strong><u>What is Heroin?</u></strong></h2>

  <p class="ParaClass1">
    Heroin is an addictive drug made from morphine, a psychoactive (mind-altering) substance taken from the resin of the
    seed pod of the opium poppy plant. The color and look of this drug depends on how it is made and what else it is
    mixed with. It can be white or brown powder or a black, sticky substance called <b><u>black tar heroin.</u></b> It
    is part of the
    class of drugs called opioids and is mixed with water, injected with a needle, sniffed, smoked or
    snorted.
    <br>
    People who take heroin sometimes combine it with other drugs, such as alcohol or cocaine which can be very
    dangerous and raise the risk of overdose.
    <br>
    When mixed with alcohol, the user can get in a coma or have dangerously slowed (or even stopped) breathing that can
    eventually lead to death.
    <br>
    Smack, Junk, Black tar, Ska and Horse are some of the common street names for Heroin.

    <strong><u>The Impact of Heroin on the Brain and Body</u></strong>
  </p>

  <p class="ParaClass1">
    When heroin enters the brain, it attaches to the molecules on the cells known as opioid receptors. These receptors
    are located in many areas of the brain and body, especially areas involved in the perception of pain and pleasure,
    as well as a part of the brain that regulates breathing.
    <br>
    Some effects of heroin include a rush of good feelings and clouded thinking and can last for a few hours. When that
    happens, people feel drowsy, their heart rate and breathing slow down but when the effects start wearing off, the
    user experiences a depressed mood and is tempted to use the drug to regain the good feelings.
    <br>
    Another factor associated with taking Heroin repeatedly is:
    <br>
    <b><u>Addiction:</u></b>
    People can have a tough time stopping the use of Heroin if they really want to and even after it causes horrific
    consequences to their health. Since it can cause changes to the brain’s functions after using it repeatedly, the
    user will feel like something bad will happen to them if they don’t take the drug again.
    This trait is what makes the drug the most addictive of all.
    <br>
    Heroin bought on the street often contains a mix of substances, including a dangerous opioid called
    <strong>fentanyl.</strong> Drug dealers add fentanyl because it is cheap which helps them to save money. Some of
    these substances can be toxic and can even clog the blood vessels of the lungs, liver, kidney or brain which can
    cause permanent damage to these organs.
    <br>
    Also, sharing drug injection equipment or engaging in risky behaviors can
    increase the risk of being exposed to diseases such as HIV and hepatitis(inflammation of the liver).

    <strong><u>Short Term Effects</u></strong>
  </p>
  <p id="para8">
    Opioid receptors are located in the brain, the brain stem, down the spinal cord, in the lungs and intestines.
    Due to the location of the receptors, using heroin can result in a wide variety of physical problems related to
    breathing and other basic life functions.
